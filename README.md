# Hey! It's Alberte.

I am a passionate **full-stack developer** with a growing fascination for **data-related projects**. Beyond functionality, I place a special emphasis on the *attention to detail* and the *aesthetic* aspect of my work. I believe that a well-designed user interface and a seamless user experience are crucial for the success of any project.

```javascript
// Full-stack Knowledge
const technologies = [
  "HTML",
  "CSS",
  "Sass",
  "JavaScript",
  "React",
  "MongoDB",
  "Mongoose",
  "Express",
];

// Iterate over the array and display each technology
technologies.map((technology) => {
  console.log(`I love working with ${technology}! ðŸ’»ðŸš€`);
});
```

Recently, my curiosity to uncover insights through **data** led me to dive into the **world of data**.
I've completed different courses on **data analysis**, **statistics**, and **machine learning**,
and be applying these newfound skills in projects
requiring deep analysis and **data visualization** to make informed decisions.

```python
# Technical Knowledge
technologies = [
    'Excel', 'Tableau', 'Power BI', 'Azure', 'Python', 'R', 'Streamlit', 'Shiny for Python',
    'Supervised Learning', 'Unsupervised Learning', 'Reinforcement Learning'
]

# Iterate over the list of technologies
for tech in technologies:
    if tech in ['Supervised Learning', 'Unsupervised Learning', 'Reinforcement Learning']:
        # Print a message for machine learning concepts
        print(f"I'm also skilled in {tech} ðŸ¤–ðŸ“Š")
    else:
        # Print a message for data analysis technologies
        print(f"I love working with {tech}! ðŸ’»ðŸš€")
```
